# mumbai-railway_sentiment_analysis
In this project, we developed a model to understand commuters' dissatisfaction towards Mumbai railway system in Greater Mumbai using ungeotagged tweets. 

The model is a two stage model.

stage 1: Detecting tweets if they are relevant or not.

stage 2: Detecting the sentiment type (positive, negative, neutral) 

Since negative tweets are critical to service quality issues in this work we primarily focussed on negative tweets.

We used all the railway station names along Western and Central railway line and some key locations and terms to search the tweets using Twitter Search API, that are relevant to this task. The search terms can be found in the attached file - search_terms.txt
