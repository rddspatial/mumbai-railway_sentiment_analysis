# mumbai-railway_sentiment_analysis
In this project, we developed a model to understand commuters' dissatisfaction towards Mumbai railway system in Greater Mumbai using ungeotagged tweets. 

The model is a two stage model.

stage 1: Detecting tweets if they are relevant or not.

stage 2: Detecting the sentiment type (positive, negative, neutral) 

Since negative tweets are critical to service quality issues in this work we primarily focussed on negative tweets.
